#' @section A note for tibble users:
#' If you use tibbles and \code{convert_tibble} is \code{TRUE} the tibble is
#' first converted to a data frame, then imputed and converted back. If
#' \code{convert_tibble} is \code{FALSE} no conversion is done. However,
#' depending on the tibble and the package version of tibble you use,
#' imputation may not be possible and some errors will be thrown.
