Description: Supply functions for the creation and handling of
    missing data as well as tools to evaluate missing data methods. Nearly
    all possibilities of generating missing data discussed by Santos et
    al. (2019) <doi:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2891360> and some additional are
    implemented.  Functions are supplied to compare parameter estimates
    and imputed values to true values to evaluate missing data methods.
    Evaluations of these types are done, for example, by Cetin-Berber et
    al. (2019) <doi:10.1177/0013164418805532> and Kim et al. (2005)
    <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bth499>.
