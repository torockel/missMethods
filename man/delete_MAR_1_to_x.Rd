\description{
Create missing at random (MAR) values using MAR1:x in a data frame or
a matrix
}
\details{
This function creates missing at random (MAR) values in the columns
specified by the argument \code{miss_cols}.
The probability for missing values is controlled by \code{p}.
If \code{p} is a single number, then the overall probability for a value to
be missing will be \code{p} in all columns of \code{miss_cols}.
(Internally \code{p} will be replicated to a vector of the same length as
\code{miss_cols}.
So, all \code{p[i]} in the following sections will be equal to the given
single number \code{p}.)
Otherwise, \code{p} must be of the same length as \code{miss_cols}.
In this case, the overall probability for a value to be missing will be
\code{p[i]} in the column \code{miss_cols[i]}.
The position of the missing values in \code{miss_cols[i]} is controlled by
\code{ctrl_cols[i]}.
The following procedure is applied for each pair of \code{ctrl_cols[i]} and
\code{miss_cols[i]} to determine the positions of missing values:

At first, the rows of \code{ds} are divided into two groups.
Therefore, the \code{cutoff_fun} calculates a cutoff value for
\code{ctrl_cols[i]} (via \code{cutoff_fun(ds[, ctrl_cols[i]], ...)}).
The group 1 consists of the rows, whose values in
\code{ctrl_cols[i]} are below the calculated cutoff value.
If the so defined group 1 is empty, the rows that have a value equal to the
cutoff value will be added to this group (otherwise, these rows will
belong to group 2).
The group 2 consists of the remaining rows, which are not part of group 1.
Now the probabilities for the rows in the two groups are set in the way
that the odds are 1:x against a missing value in \code{miss_cols[i]} for the
rows in group 1 compared to the rows in group 2.
That means, the probability for a value to be missing in group 1 divided by
the probability for a value to be missing in group 2 equals 1 divided
by x.
For example, for two equal sized groups 1 and 2, ideally the number of NAs in
group 1 divided by the number of NAs in group 2 should equal 1 divided by x.
But there are some restrictions, which can lead to some deviations from the
odds 1:x (see below).

If \code{stochastic = FALSE} (the default),
then exactly \code{round(nrow(ds) * p[i])} values will be set \code{NA} in
column \code{miss_cols[i]}.
To achieve this, it is possible that the true odds differ from 1:x.
The number of observations that are deleted in group 1 and group 2 are
chosen to minimize the absolute difference between the realized odds and 1:x.
Furthermore, if \code{round(nrow(ds) * p[i])} == 0, then no missing value
will be created in \code{miss_cols[i]}.
If \code{stochastic = TRUE}, the number of missing values in \code{miss_cols[i]}
is a random variable.
This random variable is a sum of two binomial distributed variables (one for
group 1 and one for group 2).
If \code{p} is not too high and \code{x} is not too high or to low (see
below), then the odds 1:x will be met in expectation.
But in a single dataset the odds will be unequal to 1:x most of the time.

If \code{p} is high and \code{x} is too high or too low, it is possible that
the odds 1:x and the proportion of missing values \code{p} cannot be
realized together.
For example, if \code{p[i]} = 0.9, then a maximum of \code{x} = 1.25 is possible
(assuming that  exactly 50 \% of the values are below and 50 \% of the values
are above the cutoff value in \code{ctrl_cols[i]}).
If a combination of \code{p} and \code{x} that cannot be realized together
is given to \code{delete_MAR_1_to_x}, then a warning will be generated and
\code{x} will be adjusted in such a way that \code{p} can be realized as
given to the function.

The argument \code{add_realized_x} controls whether the x of the realized
odds are added to the return value or not.
If \code{add_realized_x = TRUE}, then the realized x values for all
\code{miss_cols} will be added as an attribute to the returned object.
For \code{stochastic = TRUE} these realized x will differ from the given
\code{x} most of the time and will change if the function is rerun without
setting a seed.
For \code{stochastic = FALSE}, it is also possible that the realized odds
differ (see above). However, the realized odds will be constant over multiple
runs.

\section{Treatment of factors}{


If \code{ds[, ctrl_cols[i]]} is an unordered factor, then the concept of a
cutoff value is not meaningful and cannot be applied.
Instead, a combinations of the levels of the unordered factor is searched that
\itemize{
\item{guarantees at least a proportion of \code{prop} rows are in group 1}
\item{minimize the difference between \code{prop} and the proportion of
rows in group 1.}
}
This can be seen as a binary search problem, which is solved by the solver
from the package \code{lpSolve}, if \code{use_lpSolve = TRUE}.
If \code{use_lpSolve = FALSE}, a very simple heuristic is applied.
The heuristic only guarantees that at least a proportion of \code{prop} rows
are in group 1.
The choice \code{use_lpSolve = FALSE} is not recommend and should only be
considered, if the solver of lpSolve fails.

If \code{ordered_as_unordered = TRUE}, then ordered factors will be treated
like unordered factors and the same binary search problem will be solved for
both types of factors.
If \code{ordered_as_unordered = FALSE} (the default), then ordered factors
will be grouped via \code{cutoff_fun} as described in Details.
